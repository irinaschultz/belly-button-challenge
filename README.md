Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Interactive Dashboard!

This dashboard allows you to delve into the fascinating world of microbial diversity found in human navels. The dataset reveals intriguing insights, showing that a small handful of microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Key Features of the Dashboard:

Data Visualization: Explore the data through visually appealing charts and graphs that bring the microbial diversity to life. 

Immerse yourself in the following visualizations:

Bar Chart: Gain a quick overview of the frequency of each OTU, with the most common OTUs listed on the x-axis and their abundance or count displayed on the y-axis.

Bubble Chart: Visualize the OTUs as bubbles, with each bubble's size indicating its abundance. Colors can represent prevalence or other relevant attributes, offering a comprehensive view of the dataset.

Dropdown or Search Filters: Easily navigate the dataset by using intuitive dropdown menus or search filters. lore the dataset more effectively and discover hidden patterns or correlations.

Summary Statistics: Get a snapshot of key summary statistics about the dataset. Discover the total number of participants, the most prevalent OTUs, the average abundance of OTUs, and the range of participant ages. These statistics provide a quick overview and help guide your exploration.

Interactive Elements: Engage with the dashboard through interactive elements. 


Embark on an exciting journey through the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset using this interactive dashboard. Uncover the wonders of microbial diversity, unravel correlations, and gain valuable insights into the intricate world of human navels.
